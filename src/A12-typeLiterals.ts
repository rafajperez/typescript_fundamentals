/* In TypeScript, a type literal is a feature that allows you to define values ​as data types, 
restricting the use of types and values.
A literal is a more concrete subtype of a collection of types. For example, 
you can use a type literal to specify that a function should only accept the values ​"true" or "false" as an argument.*/

const xy = 10;
// y = 11; doesn´t alow because const has the literal value of 10 //

console.log(xy);
